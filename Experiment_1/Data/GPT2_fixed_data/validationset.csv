Twenty-four hours later, two plates were trypsinzed to get an estimate of average number of cells in each 10 cm plate. Cells were then infected with lentiviruses separately encoding either OSKM or OS(v)KM at multiplicities of infections (MOIs) that were determined to be optimal for reprogramming (see Suppl Table 2). Media was changed daily until the time of harvest on day 5. At the time of harvest, cells on plates were washed once with PBS (room temperature) and cross-linked by adding EMEM + 10% FBS containing 1% fomaldehyde. Plates were returned to the incubator and incubated for 10-15 minutes. Cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma Cat # P8340; 10ml/ml PBS) and 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Cross-linked cells from each condition (Mock infected MRC5, OSKM or OS(v)KM; all at passage 8) were scraped using a cell scraper, pooled in 15 ml tubes and pelleted. We typically pooled cross-linked cells from at least 4-5, 10cm plates per condition (~ 5 million cells) for each ChIP-Seq assay. As controls, we harvested approximately 5 million cross-linked human ES (H9 hESCs, p. 35) or human iPS cells (an iPSC line derived using OS(v)KM (3S2 hiPSC, p.20) from on 6 cm plates and grown in feeder-free conditions (on vitronectin-coated plates and grown in Essential 8 media). - Characteristics: chip antibody: Rpb1 CTD (Cell Signaling 2629S Lot: 3); cell line: MRC5 fibroblasts; protocol: Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and Myc addition; time: 5 days; passage: 8 = ",Cell Line: MRC5 - Cell Type: Fibroblast - Tissue Type: Lung - Factor: POLR2A $

Twenty-four hours later, two plates were trypsinzed to get an estimate of average number of cells in each 10 cm plate. Cells were then infected with lentiviruses separately encoding either OSKM or OS(v)KM at multiplicities of infections (MOIs) that were determined to be optimal for reprogramming (see Suppl Table 2). Media was changed daily until the time of harvest on day 5. At the time of harvest, cells on plates were washed once with PBS (room temperature) and cross-linked by adding EMEM + 10% FBS containing 1% fomaldehyde. Plates were returned to the incubator and incubated for 10-15 minutes. Cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma Cat # P8340; 10ml/ml PBS) and 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Cross-linked cells from each condition (Mock infected MRC5, OSKM or OS(v)KM; all at passage 8) were scraped using a cell scraper, pooled in 15 ml tubes and pelleted. We typically pooled cross-linked cells from at least 4-5, 10cm plates per condition (~ 5 million cells) for each ChIP-Seq assay. As controls, we harvested approximately 5 million cross-linked human ES (H9 hESCs, p. 35) or human iPS cells (an iPSC line derived using OS(v)KM (3S2 hiPSC, p.20) from on 6 cm plates and grown in feeder-free conditions (on vitronectin-coated plates and grown in Essential 8 media). - Characteristics: chip antibody: Rpb1 CTD (Cell Signaling 2629S Lot: 3); cell line: MRC5 fibroblasts; passage: 8 = ",Cell Line: MRC5 - Cell Type: Fibroblast - Tissue Type: Lung - Factor: POLR2A $

Antibody Target: USF1; antibody targetdescription: The ubiquitously expressed cellular upstream stimulatory factor (USF) consists of USF-1 and USF-2 polypeptides which independently exhibit site-specific DNA binding and are members of the c-Myc-related family of regulatory factors containing helix-loop-helix domains. USF also contains a leucine repeat that is required for efficient DNA binding. USF was originally identified as an up- stream stimulatory factor that binds the core sequence CACGTG in the adeno- virus late promoter. These findings, together with the demonstration of coop- erative interaction between USF and the initiator-binding protein, TFII-I, raises the possibility of a more general involvement of USF in transcriptional regula- tion. While expression of both USF-1 and USF-2 species is ubiquitous, different ratios of USF homo- and heterodimers are found in different cell types.; antibody vendorname: Santa Cruz Biotechnology; antibody vendorid: sc-229; treatment description: 1 h with 0.02% Ethanol (Myers); protocol description: one 15-cycle round of PCR (Myers); controlid: SL475; labexpid: SL1207,SL1080; labversion: SL1207,SL1080; replicate: 1,2; antibody vendorname: Santa Cruz Biotech; antibody vendorid: sc-229; treatment: EtOH_0.02pct; treatment description: 1 h with 0.02% EtOH (Myers); protocol: PCR1x; protocol description: 1-cycle of PCR (Myers); controlid: SL475; labexpid: SL1080; replicate: 1; replicate description: tier 1 = ",Cell Line: A549 - Cell Type: Epithelium - Tissue Type: Lung - Factor: USF1 $

Antibody Target: NRF1; antibody targetdescription: NRF1 is the mammalian homolog to the erect wing (ewg) Drosophila protein that is required for proper development of the central nervous system and indirect flight muscles. In mammals NRF1 functions as a transcription factor that activates the expression of the EIF2S1 (EIF-alpha) gene. This protein links the transcriptional modulation of key metabolic genes to cellular growth and development, and has been implicated in the control of nuclear genes required for respiration, heme biosynthesis and mitochondrialDNA transcription and replication. NRF1 forms a homodimer and binds DNA as a dimer. NRF1 shows a nuclear localization and is expressed widely in embryonic, fetal and adult tissues. Phosphorylation of NRF1 enhances DNA binding.; antibody vendorname: Abcam; antibody vendorid: ab55744; control: IgG-mus; control description: Input signal from Normal Mouse IgG ChIP-seq.; control: IgG-mus; control description: Input signal from Normal Mouse IgG ChIP-seq.; controlid: wgEncodeEH000706; replicate: 1 = ",Cell Line: GM12878 - Cell Type: B Lymphocyte - Tissue Type: Blood - Factor: NRF1 $

Twenty-four hours later, two plates were trypsinzed to get an estimate of average number of cells in each 10 cm plate. Cells were then infected with lentiviruses separately encoding either OSKM or OS(v)KM at multiplicities of infections (MOIs) that were determined to be optimal for reprogramming (see Suppl Table 2). Media was changed daily until the time of harvest on day 5. At the time of harvest, cells on plates were washed once with PBS (room temperature) and cross-linked by adding EMEM + 10% FBS containing 1% fomaldehyde. Plates were returned to the incubator and incubated for 10-15 minutes. Cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma Cat # P8340; 10ml/ml PBS) and 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Cross-linked cells from each condition (Mock infected MRC5, OSKM or OS(v)KM; all at passage 8) were scraped using a cell scraper, pooled in 15 ml tubes and pelleted. We typically pooled cross-linked cells from at least 4-5, 10cm plates per condition (~ 5 million cells) for each ChIP-Seq assay. As controls, we harvested approximately 5 million cross-linked human ES (H9 hESCs, p. 35) or human iPS cells (an iPSC line derived using OS(v)KM (3S2 hiPSC, p.20) from on 6 cm plates and grown in feeder-free conditions (on vitronectin-coated plates and grown in Essential 8 media). - Characteristics: chip antibody: Myc (R&D Systems AF3696); cell line: MRC5 fibroblasts; protocol: Oct4, Sox2-VP16, Klf4 and Myc addition; time: 5 days; passage: 8 = ",Cell Line: MRC5 - Cell Type: Fibroblast - Tissue Type: Lung - Factor: MYC $

The cross-linking reaction was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.4 M, followed by two washes with ice–cold PBS. Cells were resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold ChIP buffer A (10 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.25% Triton X-100, proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche UK, Burgess Hill, UK) and 0.1 mM PMSF), incubated for 10 min at 4°C with rotation, and centrifuged 5 min at 500 x g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of ice–cold ChIP buffer B (10 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.01% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor cocktail and 0.1 mM PMSF), incubated for 10 min at 4 °C with rotation and centrifuged for 5 min at 500 x g at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 600 μl of ice-cold ChIP lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% SDS, protease inhibitor cocktail and 0.1 mM PMSF), incubated 10 min on ice and sonicated at 5 °C using a Bioruptor™ (Diagenode, Liege, Belgium) to generate fragments an average length of 400-500 bp (10 min with 30 s “ON” and “OFF” cycles, power setting high). The lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 x g at 4 °C and the supernatants were diluted with two volumes of ice-cold ChIP dilution buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 7.5% glycerol, protease inhibitor cocktail and 0.1 mM PMSF). For each IP, 15 μl of Dynabeads® protein G were pre–incubated with 50 μg BSA and 2 μg antibody against RUNX1 (Abcam, ab23980) for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. The blocked antibody-bound protein G mix was added to 20–25 μg chromatin in a total volume of 500 μl diluted ChIP lysis buffer and incubated for 2 h at 4°C with rotation. After magnetic separation the beads were washed once with 1 ml wash buffer 1 (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), twice with 1 ml wash buffer 2 (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), once with 1 ml LiCl buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate) and twice with 1 ml TE/NaCl buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). For each wash the beads were mixed with ice-cold washing buffers for 10 min at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated DNA was eluted two times with 50 μl ChIP elution buffer (100 mM NaHCO3, 1% SDS) for 15 min at RT with shaking. At this step the input control (1% of the starting material) was included in the experimental procedure after first adjusting the final volume to 100 μl with ChIP elution buffer. The eluted DNA was incubated overnight at 65 °C in the presence of 50 μg proteinase K. The DNA was finally purified using Agencourt AMPure (Beckman Coulter) magnetic beads according to the manufacturer’s instructions, eluted with 50 μl x TE. - Characteristics: cell type: PBSC; antibody: anti-Runx1; antibody manufacturer and catalog number: Abcam; ab23980 = ",Cell Line: None - Cell Type: Stem cell - Tissue Type: Blood - Factor: RUNX1 $

C., Weissman, S. M., and Gallagher, P. G. (2009) Mol Cell Biol). 1 × 107 cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, followed by Dounce homogenization. Cross-linked nuclei were isolated, followed by sonication with a Covaris S2 shearing device (duty cycle 10%, intensity 5, 15 minutes), to obtain chromatin-containing DNA fragments with an average size of ~200-400bp. For each ChIP, 20 µg of antibody or the appropriate control IgG species was used. Samples were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against GATA1 (sc-265; Santa Cruz), NF-E2 (sc-22827; Santa Cruz), KLF1 (ab2483; Abcam), SCL/Tal1 (sc-12984; Santa Cruz), P300 (sc-585; Santa Cruz) and nonspecific rabbit IgG (sc-2091; Santa Cruz). The antigen-antibody complex was captured on protein G beads, washed four times with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The DNA-protein complex was eluted from the protein G beads with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 65°C, and cross-linking of DNA-protein adducts was reversed by 4 hours of incubation at 65°C. After proteinase K and RNase digestion of the reverse-cross-linked sample, DNA was cleaned with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer instructions. - Characteristics: cell: R3/R4 Erythroid cells; chip antibody: GATA1 = ",Cell Line: None - Cell Type: Erythroid Cell - Tissue Type: None - Factor: GATA1 $

The cross-linking reaction was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.4 M, followed by two washes with ice–cold PBS. Cells were resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold ChIP buffer A (10 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.25% Triton X-100, proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche UK, Burgess Hill, UK) and 0.1 mM PMSF), incubated for 10 min at 4°C with rotation, and centrifuged 5 min at 500 x g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of ice–cold ChIP buffer B (10 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.01% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor cocktail and 0.1 mM PMSF), incubated for 10 min at 4 °C with rotation and centrifuged for 5 min at 500 x g at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 600 μl of ice-cold ChIP lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% SDS, protease inhibitor cocktail and 0.1 mM PMSF), incubated 10 min on ice and sonicated at 5 °C using a Bioruptor™ (Diagenode, Liege, Belgium) to generate fragments an average length of 400-500 bp (10 min with 30 s “ON” and “OFF” cycles, power setting high). The lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 x g at 4 °C and the supernatants were diluted with two volumes of ice-cold ChIP dilution buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 7.5% glycerol, protease inhibitor cocktail and 0.1 mM PMSF). For each IP, 15 μl of Dynabeads® protein G were pre–incubated with 50 μg BSA and 2 μg antibody against RUNX1 (Abcam, ab23980) for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. The blocked antibody-bound protein G mix was added to 20–25 μg chromatin in a total volume of 500 μl diluted ChIP lysis buffer and incubated for 2 h at 4°C with rotation. After magnetic separation the beads were washed once with 1 ml wash buffer 1 (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), twice with 1 ml wash buffer 2 (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), once with 1 ml LiCl buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate) and twice with 1 ml TE/NaCl buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA).

The cells were collected for ChIP-seq analysis after antibiotic selection. For RNA-seq analysis, TRIM28 was knockdown was achieved with a lentiviral vector carrying shRNA sequence against TRIM28 (AATTCCCGCACTAGCTGTGAGGATAATTCAAGAGATTATCCTCACAGCTAGTGCTTTTTG). Induced pluripotent stem cells were generated using a polycistronic lentiviral vector carrying the plasmid pHAGE2-hSTEMCCA-EF1α-loxp, which was a kind gift from Professor Gustavo Mostoslavsky from Boston University School of Medicine. A week after transduction the cells were transfered into pluripotent stem cells culture conditions. IPS colonies were collected 3 weeks post transduction for further expansion and analysis. To induce differentiation, hESCs and iPSCs were cultured without FGF. - Characteristics: cell line: BG01V - ATCC SCRC-2002; modifications or treatment: Transduced with a vector with biotin ligase sequence and a vector with the sequence of selected ZNF114 tagged with the biotinylation peptide; sample type: Input = ",Cell Line: BG01V - ATCC SCRC-2002 - Cell Type: Embryonic Stem Cell - Tissue Type: None - Factor: ZNF114 $

The encoded protein contains broad complex, tramtrack, bric-a-brac/poxvirus and zinc finger (BTB/POZ) domains, which is atypical of CNC-bZip family members. These BTB/POZ domains facilitate protein-protein interactions and formation of homo- and/or hetero-oligomers. When this encoded protein forms a heterodimer with MafK, it functions as a repressor of Maf recognition element (MARE) and transcription is repressed.

It is able to form homodimers and heterodimers with other family members, which include Mad, Mxi1 and Myc. Myc is an oncoprotein implicated in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The homodimers and heterodimers compete for a common DNA target site (the E box) and rearrangement among these dimer forms provides a complex system of transcriptional regulation.

For RNA-seq the different cell lines were left untreated or treated with the cytokines or molecules indicated (Activin, XV or ChIR) for 24h or 30h in TeSR media. For the 72h RNA-seq, cells were treated for 24h with the specific treatment, and then the media was changed, and cells were collected 48h later (72h total). For ChIP-seq experiments, the YAP1 and TEAD4 ChIP-seq were performed in hESCs growing in TeSR media. In addition, the YAP1 ChIP-seq was also performed in the YAP-KO cells. The beta-catenin, Smad2,3 and CTD-Ser7P RNAPII ChIP-seq experiments were performed in the WT and the YAP-KO hESCs after Activin exposure for 15h. The PiggyYAP cell line was generated by stably transfecting the YAP-KO cells with the transposon-based vector Piggyback containing a Flag-YAP cDNA construct under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter. This system allowed us to control YAP levels in the same hESC line from zero (-Dox) to over-expression levels (aprox. Dox 50ng/ml). The ChIP-seq of CTD-Ser7P RNAPII was performed in the PiggyYAP cells treated with Activin for 15h in absence (no dox) or in presence of doxycycline (+dox). - Characteristics: genotype: WT; treatment: None; treatment_time: None; antibody: TEAD4 = ",Cell Line: H1 - Cell Type: Embryonic Stem Cell - Tissue Type: Embryo - Factor: TEAD4 $

Briefly, HEK-293 cells (1x107per 10 cm petri dish) were cross-linked directly on plates by adding 37% formaldehyde to the media in a 1.4% final concentration for 15 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was stopped by adding glycine (final concentration 125 mM) followed by incubation for 5 min, at room temperature. Cells were scraped off in 500 µl of ice-cold 2x Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and transferred to eppendorf-tubes and placed on ice. Cells were centrifuged at 2,000 g for 5 min, at 4°C, and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed in 500 µl of ice-cold immunoprecipitation (IP)-Buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% NP40) supplemented with Complete Mini protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), hereafter referred to as supplemented IP-Buffer. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 1 min, at 4°C, and washed once in ice-cold supplemented IP-Buffer. 500 µl of ice-cold supplemented IP-Buffer were added to the pelleted nuclei and sample re-suspended. Chromatin was fragmented by sonication using a Bioruptor (Diagnode) at high effect (80 cycles, 30s on plus 30s off) to generate fragments of 150-300 bp. Fragment lengths were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min, at 4°C.

Antibody Target: MYBL2; antibody targetdescription: The protein encoded by this gene, a member of the MYB family of transcription factor genes, is a nuclear protein involved in cell cycle progression. The encoded protein is phosphorylated by cyclin A/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 during the S-phase of the cell cycle and possesses both activator and repressor activities.

Twenty-four hours later, two plates were trypsinzed to get an estimate of average number of cells in each 10 cm plate. Cells were then infected with lentiviruses separately encoding either OSKM or OS(v)KM at multiplicities of infections (MOIs) that were determined to be optimal for reprogramming (see Suppl Table 2). Media was changed daily until the time of harvest on day 5. At the time of harvest, cells on plates were washed once with PBS (room temperature) and cross-linked by adding EMEM + 10% FBS containing 1% fomaldehyde. Plates were returned to the incubator and incubated for 10-15 minutes. Cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma Cat # P8340; 10ml/ml PBS) and 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Cross-linked cells from each condition (Mock infected MRC5, OSKM or OS(v)KM; all at passage 8) were scraped using a cell scraper, pooled in 15 ml tubes and pelleted. We typically pooled cross-linked cells from at least 4-5, 10cm plates per condition (~ 5 million cells) for each ChIP-Seq assay. As controls, we harvested approximately 5 million cross-linked human ES (H9 hESCs, p. 35) or human iPS cells (an iPSC line derived using OS(v)KM (3S2 hiPSC, p.20) from on 6 cm plates and grown in feeder-free conditions (on vitronectin-coated plates and grown in Essential 8 media). - Characteristics: chip antibody: Oct4 (Abcam ab19857 Lot: GR187600-1); cell line: MRC5 fibroblasts; protocol: Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and Myc addition; time: 5 days; passage: 8 = ",Cell Line: MRC5 - Cell Type: Fibroblast - Tissue Type: Lung - Factor: POU5F1 $
