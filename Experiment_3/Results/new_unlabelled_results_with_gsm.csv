CD34+CD38-CD33-Rho(lo)c-kit+ and CD34+CD38-CD33-Rho(hi) fractions were selected by sequential Ficol-Hypaque separation, MACS column depletion and fluorescence activated cell sorting. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit (Arcturus, Mountain View, California) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Seven to ten thousand Rho(lo) and Rho(hi) cells were sorted directly into 100 mcL Extraction Buffer (XB) provided with the PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit (Arctutus) prior to RNA isolation. Labeled complimentary-RNA (cRNA) was generated by one round of IVT-based, linear amplification using the RiboAmp OA RNA Amplification Kit (Arcturus) followed by labeling with the Enzo Bioarray™ HighYield™ RNA Transcript Labeling Kit (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, New York) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Affymetrix® HG-U133 GeneChips™ were processed using Genedata Refiner software (GeneData, San Francisco, California) to assess overall quality.

The addition of substrate and a chemiluminescence enhancer initiates the chemiluminescent reaction. Eight images were collected for each microarray using the 1700 analyzer including 2 “short” chemiluminescent images (5 seconds exposure length each) and 2 “long” chemiluminescent images (25 seconds exposure length each) for gene expression analysis, 2 fluorescent images for feature finding and spot normalization and 2 QC images for spectrum cross-talk correction.

Equal amounts of RNA from one to four individuals per stage per floret type (i.e., upper or lower) were pooled randomly to generate one biological replicate. In total, 24 biological replicates (two biological replicates per stage per floret type) were generated. Approximately 100 ng of total RNA from each biological replicate were used as starting material for T7-based linear RNA amplification, performed as described by Nakazono et al. (2003). Each biological replicate yielded between 30 and 50 micrograms of amplified RNA (aRNA).

During the DASL assay gene specific primers with either Cy3 or Cy5 are incorporated into the product which is hybridised. The gene specific primers are produced as a pool which contains both Cy3 and Cy5 within the pool (therefore some primers for gene 'A' will have Cy3 others will have Cy5). Thus after hybridisation the signal of Cy3 and Cy5 is combined to produce the raw signal (one single raw signal per probe). The DASL assay uses an amended version of Illumina's Goldengate assay which integrates SNPs to determine genotype with either a Cy3 or Cy5. In the case of DASL the sum of the Cy3 and Cy5 is the raw expression of the gene. No independent hybridizations were performed. = Assay name: whole-genome shotgun bisulfite-seq - Assay type: DNA methylation - Target of assay: None - Genome assembly: GRCh38,hg19 - Biosample term name: DASL - Project: ENCODE - Organism: Homo sapiens - Life stage: adult - Age: 36 - Age units: year - Sex: female - Ethnicity: Caucasian - Health status: unknown - Classification: cell line - Investigated as: None $ <pad>"

This study has been approved by the ethical committee of the Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Tumour tissue was stored at -135C until use. Tumours were histopathologically diagnosed by Prof. V.P. Collins according to World Health Organization Brain tumour classification criteria. Total RNA was extracted using CsCl ultracentrifugation and asessed spectrophotometrically and using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. Only RNA with no trace of degradation was used. 7 ug of total RNA were used for preparation of labelled target. Sample preparation, first and second strand cDNA synthesis, in vitro transcription amplification for production of biotin labelled cRNA, fragmentation of cRNA, U133A GeneChip hybridization, staining, washing and scanning were performed exactly as described by the manufacturer (Affymeytrix,Santa Clara). Hybridization was performed using 15 ug of labelled fragmented cRNA for 16 hours using a hybridization oven 640 as described by the manufacturer (Affymetrix, Santa Clara). Post-Hybridization washing and staining of the U133A GeneChips was performed on a fluidics station 400 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara) and scanning was performed on a GeneArray scanner (Affymetrix, Santa Clara). = Assay name: RNA-seq - Assay type: Transcription - Target of assay: None - Genome assembly: GRCh38,hg19 - Biosample term name: astrocyte - Project: ENCODE - Organism: Homo sapiens - Life stage: child - Age: 15 - Age units: year - Sex: female - Ethnicity: None - Health status: normal - Classification: primary cell - Investigated as: None $ <pad>"

The most common congenital cardiac abnormalities are associated with the defects in cardiac septation and outflow tract development. Specifically, atrial septal defects (ASDs) account for about one third of the cases detected in adults. To address this question it is imperative to get insight into the genes expressed during normal heart development. Timed matings were performed using C57BL/6 mice and pregnant females sacrificed starting at embryonic day (E) 10.5, and then in daily intervals until E14.5. These developmental stages have been selected as they encompass stages of septation of the atrial and ventricular chambers as well as the cardiac outflow tract. Gene expression was further analyzed at E16.5 and E18.5, to monitor changes in gene expression related to maturation of the heart. At stage 10.5 and 11.5, we have removed the rostral and caudal parts of the embryo and subjected the middle part, which includes the heart, for expression analysis. From embryonic day 12.5 on, we isolated embryonic hearts and separated the ventricular from the atrial chambers.; Keywords : cardiac development, heart = Assay name: ChIP-seq - Assay type: DNA binding - Target of assay: None - Genome assembly: GRCh38,hg19 - Biosample term name: hepatocyte cell - Project: ENCODE - Organism: Homo sapiens - Life stage: embryonic kidney,genus unknown - Age: 16.5 - Age units: day - Sex: female - Ethnicity: None - Health status: None - Classification: in vitro differentiated cells - Investigated as: None $ <pad>"

RNA quality was verified by electrophoresis through agarose gel upon visualization with ethidium bromide and only RNA samples with a ratio >1 for 28S/18S ribosomal RNA were further processed. A two-round RNA amplification procedure was carried out. Normal larynx and hypopharynx samples was used as reference for hybridizations, these samples were processed in the same manner as tumor samples. Amplified RNA were then used in a transcriptase reverse reaction into cDNA in the presence of Cy3- or Cy5-labeled dCTP = Assay name: RNA-seq - Assay type: Transcription - Target of assay: None - Genome assembly: None - Biosample term name: lary gland - Project: ENCODE - Organism: Homo sapiens - Life stage: adult - Age: unknown - Age units: None - Sex: female - Ethnicity: None - Health status: None - Classification: tissue - Investigated as: None $ <pad>"
