There, the tissues were minced with a blade and 1gm of tissue was placed into a cryovial with 1mL of freezing solution (freezing solution 50mL: 25mL DMEM, 10mL Normosol-R, 10mL 25% BSA, 5mL DMSO, 1 tablet protease inhibitor) for 15min on ice. The cyrovial was then placed in a 1inch-thick styrofoam container, and then placed into -80C freezer, resulting in a slow freezing to -80C over an 1hour period.; donor_id: STL001; donor_age: year 3; donor_health_status: NA; donor_sex: Male; donor_ethnicity: NA; experiment_type: Chromatin Accessibility; extraction_protocol: Qiagen minElut; dnase_protocol: http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/protocols/type/experimental/  heart male child (3 years) Heart primary tissue from a healthy 3 year old male human from the Lin laboratory. = Assay name: ChIP-seq - Assay type: DNA binding - Target of assay: None - Genome assembly: GRCh38,hg19 - Biosample term name: heart - Project: Roadmap - Organism: Homo sapiens - Life stage: child - Age: 3 - Age units: year - Sex: male - Ethnicity: None - Health status: None - Classification: tissue - Investigated as: None $ <pad>"
