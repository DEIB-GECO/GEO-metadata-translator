Protocol overview; 4.2.1. cRNA target preparation; The biotin-labelled cRNA target is prepared by a linear amplifi cation; method. The poly(A)+ RNA (mRNA) subpopulation within the total RNA; population is primed for reverse transcription by a DNA oligonucleotide; containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter 5’ to a d(T)24 sequence. After second-strand cDNA synthesis, the cDNA serves as the; template for an in vitro transcription (IVT) reaction to produce the; target cRNA. The IVT is performed in the presence of biotinylated; nucleotides to label the target cRNA. This method produces; approximately 1 000- to 5 000-fold linear amplifi cation of the input; mRNA.; A set of bacterial mRNA controls is included in each CodeLink iExpress; Assay Reagent Kit to serve as an overall platform performance; control group, and can also be used to estimate the sensitivity of RNA; detection.; 13; An independent total RNA control (HeLa) and an exogenous cDNA; IVT control (pTRI-Xef 1 plasmid) are also included in each CodeLink; iExpress Assay Reagent Kit. The HeLa RNA can be used to monitor; overall kit performance; the pTRI-Xef 1 plasmid can be used to; evaluate IVT performance.; 4.2.2. Target hybridization and bioarray processing; Hybridization is performed overnight in a temperature-controlled; shaking incubator. Optimized hybridization buffer components; are included in CodeLink iExpress Assay Reagent Kit for use at this; step. The instructions for performing the hybridization and posthybridization; processing steps and bioarray processing are provided; in the CodeLink Gene Expression System: Single-Assay Bioarray; Hybridization and Detection protocol or the CodeLink Gene; Expression System: 16-Assay Bioarray Hybridization and Detection; protocol, depending on the bioarray format to be used.; Post-hybridization processing includes a stringent wash to remove; unbound and non-specifi cally hybridized target molecules, a; secondary-labeling step using a Cy™5-Streptavidin conjugate, and; several washing steps to remove unbound conjugate.

The gene specific primers are produced as a pool which contains both Cy3 and Cy5 within the pool (therefore some primers for gene 'A' will have Cy3 others will have Cy5). Thus after hybridisation the signal of Cy3 and Cy5 is combined to produce the raw signal (one single raw signal per probe). The DASL assay uses an amended version of Illumina's Goldengate assay which integrates SNPs to determine genotype with either a Cy3 or Cy5. In the case of DASL the sum of the Cy3 and Cy5 is the raw expression of the gene. No independent hybridizations were performed. = "

Dev Genet 1990; 11:270-279.]; ; Total RNA was isolated from 200 mg of embryonic tissue, using guanidinium isothiocyanate in combination with acidic phenol (pH 4.0) (fast RNA tube green kit from BIO101) in a fast prep homogenizer FP120 (BIO 101). After precipitation, the RNA was dissolved in DEPC-treated water (Ambion) and spectrophotometrically quantified using a GeneQuant RNA/DNA calculator (Pharmacia Biotech). cDNA was synthesized upon total RNA as a template, using the SuperScript Choice System for cDNA synthesis (Gibco/BRL) with a T7-(T)24 DNA primer.; This primer (5'-GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(T)24VN-3') was purified by PAGE. For first-strand cDNA synthesis, a typical 40 ul reaction contained 25 ug RNA, 200 pmol T7-(T)24 primer, 500 uM of each dNTP and 800 units reverse transcriptase (AMV Superscript II). The reaction was incubated for 1 h at 42°C. Second-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out at 18°C for 2 h in a total volume of 340 ul, using 20 units Escherichia coli DNA ligase, 80 units E. coli DNA polymerase I and 4 units RNase H in the presence of 250 uM of each dNTP. After second-strand cDNA synthesis, 0.5 ul RNase A (100 mg/ml) (Qiagen) was added and the samples were incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Thereafter, 7.5 ul proteinase K (10 mg/ml) (Sigma) was added and the samples were further incubated at 37°C for another 30 min. After cDNA synthesis was completed, samples were phenol-chloroform extracted, using Phase Lock Gel (5 Prime-3 Prime) and ethanol precipitated. Biotinylated antisense cRNA was synthesized from the dsDNA template, using T7 RNA polymerase (MEGAscript T7 Kit: Ambion.). A 20 ul reaction volume contained between 0.3-1.5 ug cDNA, 7.5 mM of both ATP and GTP, 5.6 mM of both UTP and CTP and 1.8 mM of both biotinylated Bio-16-UTP and Bio-11-CTP (ENZO diagnostics) and 2 ul 10x T7 enzyme mix. The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 8 h. Thereafter, the unincorporated NTPs were removed by running the sample over an RNeasy spin column (Qiagen). Samples were precipitated, taken up in 20 ul DEPC-treated water and spectrophotometrically quantified. Thereafter, 40 ug of the biotinylated antisense cRNA was fragmented by heating the sample to 95°C for 35 min in a volume of 25 ul, containing 40 mM tris-acetate (pH 8.1), 100 mM potassium acetate, 30 mM magnesium acetate. After the fragmentation, the samples were placed on ice.; Gene Chips were pre-hybridized with 220 ul hybridization buffer (1x MES (pH 6.7), 1 M NaCl, 0.01% Triton, 0.5 g/l acetylated BSA, 0.5 g/l sonicated herring sperm DNA) for 15 min at 45°C on a rotisserie (Heidolph) at 60 rpm. Hybridization was done in a final volume of 220 ul hybridization buffer, containing 40 g fragmented biotinylated cRNA. The samples were heated to 95°C for 5 min and briefly spun down. Hybridizations were carried out for 16 h at 45°C with mixing on a rotisserie at 60 rpm. After hybridization, the arrays were briefly rinsed with 6x SSPE-T (0.9 M NaCl, 0.06 M NaH2PO4, 6 mM EDTA, 0.01% Triton) and washed on a Fluidics station (Affymetrix). Hybridized arrays were stained with 220 ul detection solution (1x MES buffer, containing 2.5 ul streptavidin-R phycoerythrin conjugate (1 mg/ml) (Molecular Probes)) and 2.0 mg/ml acetylated BSA (Sigma) at 40°C for 15 min and washed again before being scanned.; ; The data was normalized against the mean of the total sums of Avg Diff values across all 16 arrays used in this study. = "

The RNA was degraded with the addition of 20 l volume of 0.5N sodium hydroxide and 0.25 M EDTA for 20 minutes at 65 C. The single stranded cDNA was purified using a commercial kit (Qiagen Qiaquick).; The resulting product of single stranded cDNA was placed in its entirety in a second strand reaction. Second strand synthesis reactions utilized shT7N9 random primer and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase utilizing standard reaction conditions (37 C for 60 minutes, 0.2 mM DTT, 2.1 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 2.1 mM MgCl2, 10.7 mM NaCl, 1.07 mM dNTPs, 0.1U/ l Klenow), followed by another Qiaquick purification. Multiple polymerase chain reactions were run using 0.15 g of double stranded DNA and standard reaction conditions. Amplification was achieved using 10 cycles of PCR with the DP256 and T7 primers (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.4, 50 mM KCl, 0.01 mM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.01 U/ l Taq Polymerase) DP256: 5'- GTT CGA GAC CTC TAG ATG CTG TTG -3' T7: 5'- AA TTA ATA CGA CTC ACT ATA GGG AGA -3' followed by Qiaquick purification.; Further amplification was achieved using in vitro transcription reactions with X0.5 g dsDNA and T7 RNA Polymerase (7.5 mM DTT, 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 14.25 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaCl, 2 mM Spermidine, 125 U/ml RNAguard, 2.5 mM dNTPs, 15 U/ml IPPase, 25kU/ml T7 Polymerase) for 16 hours at 42 C.

RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer recommended protocol. Briefly, once the tissue was homogenized, RNA was extracted through chloroform addition, which separated the STAT-60 reagent into a heavy phenol chloroform phase and a light colorless upper aqueous phase, which contained the RNA. The aqueous phase was removed and mixed with isopropanol in order to precipitate RNA. The precipitated RNA was washed with 75% ethanol, and then dried for 5-10 minutes. The RNA pellet was then dissolved in nuclease-free water (Ambion). Once the pellet was completely dissolved, the RNA was cleaned using the Qiagen RNEasy Mini Kit (Catalog # 74104, Qiagen, Maryland, USA) in order to remove any traces of ethanol that may interfere with the reverse transcription reaction.; For the control, RNA from the following C57 mouse tissues were pooled in the proportions indicated in parentheses: white adipose tissue (5%), skeletal muscle (12%), brain (4%), heart(1%), lung (6%), testes (2%), hypothalamus (6%), brown adipose tissue (13%), kidney (26%), and liver (26%). This was done in order to maximize the number of genes represented in the control, and thereby enable the quantification of as many spots as possible on the array.; The total RNA harvested was labeled and hybridized to DNA microarrays to measure the abundance of transcripts present. Total RNA control samples were labeled using Cy3 dCTP (Perkin-Elmer), and total RNA experimental samples were labeled using Cy5 dCTP (Perkin-Elmer) during reverse transcription. For reverse transcription 10 ug of total RNA was aliquoted into a 6 uL volume. If concentration of the RNA was necessary, this was conducted using a speed vacufuge (Eppendorf) at 60 ºC for 10 minutes. The RNA sample was then mixed with 2 uL of 10X Cy-labeled dCTP, 2 uL of 100 mM DTT (Invitrogen), 4 uL of 5X First Strand Buffer (Invitrogen), 2 uL of a dNTP mixture containing 5 mM dGTP, dATP, dTTP and 2 mM dCTP (Invitrogen), 2 uL of 0.5 mg/ mL oligo-dT18-20 (Invitrogen), and 2 uL of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). This reaction mixture was incubated at 42 ºC for approximately two hours. Following the reverse transcription reaction, the RNA template was degraded by addition of 2 uL of 1 N NaOH and incubation at 65 ºC for 10 minutes. The alkaline conditions were then neutralized by addition of 2 uL of 1 N HCl. Samples were then combined with their controls. The combined sample was cleaned to remove extra primers and nucleotides using a QIAquick Nucleotide Removal kit as described by the manufacturer's instructions. Once cleaned, the sample was concentrated using a speed vacufuge (Eppendorf) for 20 minutes at 65 ºC. Following concentration, the sample was resuspended in 40 uL of prewarmed hybridization buffer (Clontech Laboratories), and hybridized to duplicate oligonucleotide microarrays, and 20 ul was dispensed on each array. Hybridization occurred overnight at 55 ºC using Corning hybridization chambers. The following day the arrays were washed in Glass Hybridization Wash Solution (Clontech Laboratories), and then in 1X SSC, and finally 0.1X SSC. Each wash step was conducted for 20 minutes under high agitation. The arrays were dried by centrifugation and scanned using GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments). The resulting data was downloaded and formatted in Excel (Microsoft), and then analyzed using Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc.).; The arrays used for hybridization were prepared using GAPS glass slides (Corning), and a Virtek arrayer (Bio-Rad). These arrays contained 17,280 features, printed from a synthesized oligonucleotide mouse library (Operon). Briefly, the library was resuspended in 3X SSC, centrifuged, and loaded into the arrayer. Arrays were printed using 32 pins (Telechem), at approximately 50% humidity. Once printed, the probes were crosslinked to the glass slides using a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene). = "

The most common congenital cardiac abnormalities are associated with the defects in cardiac septation and outflow tract development. Specifically, atrial septal defects (ASDs) account for about one third of the cases detected in adults. To address this question it is imperative to get insight into the genes expressed during normal heart development. Timed matings were performed using C57BL/6 mice and pregnant females sacrificed starting at embryonic day (E) 10.5, and then in daily intervals until E14.5. These developmental stages have been selected as they encompass stages of septation of the atrial and ventricular chambers as well as the cardiac outflow tract. Gene expression was further analyzed at E16.5 and E18.5, to monitor changes in gene expression related to maturation of the heart. At stage 10.5 and 11.5, we have removed the rostral and caudal parts of the embryo and subjected the middle part, which includes the heart, for expression analysis. From embryonic day 12.5 on, we isolated embryonic hearts and separated the ventricular from the atrial chambers.; Keywords : cardiac development, heart = "

Fourteen radiation-therapy patients suffered unusual levels of radiation toxicity (RadS). Thirteen radiation-therapy patients with limited toxicity (RadC) were enrolled as controls. Fifteen patients diagnosed with skin cancer before age 40 (SkCa) were used as a second group of controls. Fifteen healthy subjects without any history of cancer (NoCa) were matched to the skin cancer patients and used as a third group of controls.; ; Cells were exposed to mock treatment (Mock), ultra-violet radiation (UV), or ionizing radiation (IR). For UV radiation treatment, cells were exposed to 10 J/m^2 and harvested for RNA 24 hours later. For IR treatment, cells were exposed to 5 Gy of IR and harvested for RNA 4 hours later. For example, RadS1-Mock refers to cells from radiation sensitive patient 1 exposed to mock treatment.; ; Data were analyzed with Affymetrix MAS version 4.0.; ; Normalization – A reference data set was generated by averaging the expression of each gene over all data sets. The data for each hybridization were compared with the reference data set in a cube root scatter plot. A linear least-squares fit to the cube root scatter plot was then used to normalize each hybridization.; Keywords : Gene expression in lymphoid cells of cancer patients = "
